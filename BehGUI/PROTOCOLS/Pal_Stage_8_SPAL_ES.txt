######## for Mark, 1) cabin light is not working, 2) for wrong action, CAB_LIGHT TURNS ON FOR HOW LONG?
######## 3) Can you do no consequence for touching outside of correct and wrong images?

##  Stage 8: sPAL                                                                                        ##
##  Duration: 45 sessions, 3600s (60 minutes)                                                            ##
##  Trial number: 36                                                                                     ##
##  Description: Make sure tone duration is set to 1000 ms, ITI period is set to 20s, Food/CM            ##
##  pulse time [800ms (20 ï¿½l SM), time out (TO, 5s). The session begins with a priming                   ##
##  delivery of reinforcer and on exiting the food magazine the first trial begins. Following tray       ##
##  exit a S+ image/location pair and a S- image/location pair are presented in 2 windows                ##
##  and the third window is blank. A correct response, touching at the location in which the             ##
##  S+ stimulus was presented, will trigger the presentation of a reinforcer into the food               ##
##  magazine. Reinforcer delivery is accompanied by illumination of the tray light and a tone.           ##
##  The tone duration is 1000 ms. The subject collects the food by making an entry at the                ##
##  food magazine. On exiting the food tray, the ITI (20s) will begin. After the ITI period, the         ##
##  tray light comes on again and the mouse must enter and exit the food tray to start the               ##
##  next trial. An incorrect response, i.e. touching the S- image/location pair will cause a time        ##
##  out (TO, 5s) and the house light to be turned ON. After the TO, the house light will be              ##
##  turned OFF and the ITI will begin (20s). After the ITI the tray light will come on and the           ##
##  mouse must enter and exit the food tray to start the correction trial. The next trial does           ##
##  not begin until a response is made, ie. no time-out/no omissions. In a correction trial the          ##
##  same S+/S- image/location pairs are repeated from the previous trial and repeated each               ##
##  subsequent trial until a correct choice is made. The results of correction trials do not count       ##
##  toward criteria for completion of the session.                                                       ##
##  Criterion: 36 trials within 60 min, for 45 days.6                                                    ##
