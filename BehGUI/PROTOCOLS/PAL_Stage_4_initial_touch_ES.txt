##  Stage 4: 'Initial touch'                                                                                ##
##  Duration: Number of sessions varies across mice, 3600s (60 minutes)                                     ##
##  Trial number: 30                                                                                        ##
##  Description: Make sure that �Image Time� is 30s;  �tone                                                 ##
##  duration� is 1000 ms, and ITI period is 10s. The stimulus (white square, which is not                   ##
##  designated for use in dPAL/sPAL trials) is displayed in either the left, right or centre                ##
##  window. The other windows are blank. The position is chosen pseudo randomly, such                       ##
##  that the stimulus will not be displayed in the same position more than 3 times in a row.                ##
##  After a delay (Image Time � 30s) the stimulus is removed and a reinforcer is delivered.                 ##
##  Food delivery is accompanied by illumination of the tray light                                          ##
##  and a tone. The tone frequency is 3 KHz. The tone duration is (1000 ms). Entry to collect               ##
##  the food turns off the tray light and starts the ITI. After the ITI period (20s) another stimulus       ##
##  is displayed. If the mouse touches the screen while the stimulus is displayed the stimulus              ##
##  is removed and a tone will be played and 3 x reward volume is dispensed. Collection of                  ##
##  this reward again starts the ITI and then progresses to the next stimulus. Touch training               ##
##  is performed with the house light off.                                                                  ##
##  Criterion: Completion of 30 trials within 60 min. Repeat sessions until criterion is                    ##
##  achieved.                                                                                               ##
