##  Stage 6: 'Must initiate'                                                                             ##
##  Duration: Number of sessions varies across mice, 3600s (60 minutes)                                  ##
##  Trial number: 30                                                                                     ##
##  Description: This schedule trains the mouse to initiate after an ITI. Make sure tone                 ##
##  duration is set to 1000 ms (from the ‘Tone Duration’ variable) and ITI period is set to 20s.         ##
##  A free reinforcer is delivered, and the tray light is turned on. The mouse must nose poke            ##
##  and exit the reward tray before a stimulus is displayed randomly on the screen. The                  ##
##  stimulus (white square) position is chosen pseudo randomly, such that the stimulus will              ##
##  not be displayed in the same position more than 3 times in a row. The mouse must touch               ##
##  the stimulus to elicit tone/food response. There is no response if the mouse touches the             ##
##  blank part of the screen. Food delivery is accompanied by illumination of the tray light and         ##
##  a tone. The tone frequency default is 3 KHz. Entry to collect the food turns off the tray            ##
##  light and starts the ITI. After the ITI period the tray light is again illuminated. The mouse        ##
##  must nose poke and exit the reward tray before the next stimulus is displayed.                       ##
##  Criterion: Completion of 30 trials within 60 min. Repeat sessions until criterion is                 ##
##  achieved.                                                                                            ##
