##  Stage 5: 'Must touch'                                                                                ##
##  Description: Make sure tone duration is set to 1000 ms (from the �Tone Duration� variable)           ##
##  and ITI period is set to 20s. The stimulus is presented in only one window at a time.                ##
##  The other windows are blank. The position is chosen pseudo randomly, such that the stimulus          ##
##  will not be displayed in the same position more than 3 times in a row. The mouse must touch          ##
##  the stimulus to receive reinforcement. No reinforcer is delivered if the mouse touches the           ##
##  blank part of the screen. Reinforcer delivery is accompanied by illumination of the tray             ##
##  light and a tone. The tone frequency default is 3 KHz. Entry to collect the food turns off           ##
##  the tray light and starts the ITI. After the ITI period (20s) another stimulus is displayed.         ##
##  Criterion: Completion of 30 trials within 60 min. Repeat sessions until criterion is achieved.       ##
