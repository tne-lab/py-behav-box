##  Stage 2: habituation2a                                                           ##
##  Duration: 2 sessions, 1200s (20 minutes)                                         ##
##  Trial number: Unlimited                                                          ##
##  Description: The tray light is initially turned on. A tone is played and         ##
##  the food-tray/magazine is primed with strawberry milkshake (SM) delivered        ##
##   for 6000ms (150µl). The program waits for the mouse to enter the food tray.     ##
##  When the mouse leaves the reward tray, the reward tray light is turned off.      ##
##  There is a 10s delay before the tray light is turned on, a tone is played        ##
##  and SM is then delivered for 800ms (20 µl)1. If the mouse is in the reward       ##
##  tray at the end of the 10s delay, an extra 1s is added to the delay.             ##
##  The procedure is repeated until the session ends. It is critical that the mouse  ##
##  is removed from the cabinet as soon as the habituation is complete.              ##
##  Criterion: Drinks milkshake (none observed in tray).                             ##
